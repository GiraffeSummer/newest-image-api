<h1>Gif Monkey</h1>
<p>
  This is a (reaction) gif API,
  Feel free to log in and ask me (criPPLe RiCK#7355) for upload perms.

  I want to mainly have anime reaction gifs, as they're more lighthearted and usually pretty fun.
  This will also make it more coheisive

 or have any suggestions,
 feel free to also message me.
